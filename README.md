# E-commerce-Database-Setup-USING-ORACLE-
E-commerce Database Setup The project undertaken involved the comprehensive setup and management of an e-commerce database system. It encompassed multiple facets of database administration, security, performance optimization, and automation â€¢ The project commenced with user role definition and privilege assignment. 
The project commenced with user role definition and privilege assignment. Distinct roles were established, including SYS and ADMIN, each with specific access permissions to tables such as CUSTOMER, ORDERS, PRODUCTS, and ORDERITEM. These privileges facilitated secure data management.
Security measures were paramount. Redaction policies were implemented to protect sensitive data, such as email addresses and phone numbers, from unauthorized access. Access control ensured that only authorized users could access the database.

Data integrity and availability were guaranteed through a robust backup and recovery plan. The Oracle Recovery Manager (RMAN) was employed to define backup strategies and schedule regular backups, ensuring minimal data loss and swift recovery in case of failures.
Efficient database performance was achieved through query optimization. Full table scans were identified and mitigated by creating suitable indexes, including function-based indexes to enhance query efficiency.
Routine maintenance was automated using Oracle Scheduler. Index rebuilding and statistics gathering tasks were scheduled to optimize database performance further.
SQL queries were crafted to generate comprehensive reports, facilitating insights into customer orders, product listings, quantities in stock, and more. These reports were produced in both HTML and CSV formats
